I made this application as a side project to test my ability to deal with ML models and design a phone application. \n\n\tThe function of this application is to take in a picture captured by your camera, see if there is a human face in it, and identify the emotion shown. Of course, because no model is perfect, sometimes a face will be detected when there isn't one and vice versa. But, it functions pretty well given the complexity of the demands.\n\n\t All the code is on my github (look up txcheng) and feel free to email me at: txcheng@dons.usfca.edu!")
